# Scheme-Interpreter
A toy implementation of an interpreter for a scheme-ish language. I expanded on the project by Pieter Kelchtermans [https://pkelchte.wordpress.com/2013/12/31/scm-go/] and took inspiration from the classic scheme and also racket. This was just an idea to further my understanding of functional programming and also Go on the way.
